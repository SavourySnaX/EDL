Emulation Description Language
------------------------------

Requires Bison/Yacc,lex/flex,llvm (3.4) to build the compiler.

Invaders needs the above compiler plus opengl and glfw (3.0.4). 

Only tested under mingw32 so far. It should build under linux, but the makefile will need tweaking to include the correct libraries.

make

will build the compiler.

tests/ folder includes a simple test harness for validating the 8080 example cores work.

examples/ folder includes a few examples :)

	Invaders - Uses the pin accurate 8080 core, shows a logic analyser while running.
	Simple Invaders - Uses the step based 8080 core.
	Language - Contains a few small examples of constructs available in EDL.
	ZXSpectrum - Both a step based, and a pin accurate Z80 version.
	vic20 - Includes 1541 disk drive emulation + a lot of debug windows.
	c64 - Includes 1541 disk drive emulation -- Incomplete.
	NES - WIP (has a composite TV signal generator built in.. but output requires an external repository.

Instructions To Setup Dev Environment For MSYS2 on Windows (MSYS2 64bit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download MSYS2 @ http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/latest/download 

Run the setup and install
Launch the MSYS2 shell
pacman -Sy
pacman --needed -S bash pacman pacman-mirrors msys2-runtime
exit (may need to do a few times till the window closes)
Launch the MINGW-64 shell (recomend 64bit)
update-core
pacman -Su
pacman -S make git bison flex mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-llvm mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw
git clone https://github.com/SavourySnaX/EDL.git
cd EDL
make
cd examples/ZXSpectrum
make

now find a copy of the 48k spectrum rom image, and place in roms/48k.rom

./spectrum
