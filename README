Emulation Description Language
------------------------------

Requires Bison/Yacc,lex/flex,llvm (6.0) to build the compiler.

Most of the examples require plus opengl and glfw (3.0.4).

I've now switched over to use cmake for development.

tests/ folder includes a simple test harness for validating the 8080 example cores work.

examples/ folder includes a few examples :)

	Invaders - Uses the pin accurate 8080 core, shows a logic analyser while running.
	Simple Invaders - Uses the step based 8080 core.
	Language - Contains a few small examples of constructs available in EDL.
	ZXSpectrum - Both a step based, and a pin accurate Z80 version.
	vic20 - Includes 1541 disk drive emulation + a lot of debug windows.
	c64 - Includes 1541 disk drive emulation -- Incomplete.
	NES - WIP (has a composite TV signal generator built in.. but output requires an external repository.)
	2600 - WIP
	zx80 - WIP (no display, currently just runs the rom)
	EDLSpectrum - Another spectrum emulator, but this time using bus connections etc.
